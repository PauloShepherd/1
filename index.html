                    I met Paul in Belgium during a language-summer-camp-for-kids experience in CERAN campus in Ferrières. There, I had a good fortune of crossing paths with him periodically, even as we collaborated on two different strands of educational undertaking - Paul in the actual language instruction and I as overseer of the post-classroom activities.

                    During our weeks together, I got to know Paul unmistakably as a young man of skill, integrity and truly fantastic personality. In one phrase all-around pleasure whenever and wherever! 
                
                    Moreover, as one of the managers living on-site, I witnessed Paul's own performance as integral to the overall level of the English language instruction in CERAN, based on both of my own observations as well as the input I encountered speaking to young learners that Paul taught. Crucially, Paul never wavered from displaying a positive attitude throughout his stay in CERAN. Such impression included time I spent with him away from the everyday work matters, during our off-days.
                    
                    All told, Paul would definitely be an asset with his attitude that inspires excellence. I am strongly convinced that any potential employer, looking to add a quality and reliable employee, would be fortunate to add Paul to its ranks. Consequently, based on my experience and my estimate, one could well assumed that the prospective learners would also benefit from the skill and contributions they would conceivably receive from him.

                    With that in mind, I wholeheartedly recommend Paul with full and endorsement!

                    It was a real pleasure working with Paul at Windsor. He is an amazing person and a colleague anyone would want to work with. He is really good at teaching general English courses to adults making his every lesson interesting and creative. Paul also prepared students for IELTS exams, sharing all the knowledge and skills he has to help them get the score that they needed. He makes the most difficult and confusing topic easy to understand and helps you feel the language the way any native does.
                    
                    Paul is great with children who love his lessons and adore him, they think of him as a friend and pick up everything he teaches them very easily and naturally by playing games and having fun in the class.

                   Paul came to Windsor Education Centre in 2014 as a newly qualified teacher; bright, cheerful and engaging. He quickly made a mark, teaching a variety of students from teens to adults, but it was his success with the younger learners in the Kids Club which most sticks in my mind.
                    
                    Windsor strives to offer an environment where teachers can develop their professional skills - and this played directly to one of Paul's greatest strengths. It is not so easy to deal with a foreign culture while meeting the demands of a challenging profession, but Paul's ability to listen, watch and absorb lessons from those around him has been crucial. At the same time he was busy supplementing his knowledge with online professional development courses from Cambridge. I've been delighted to witness his success.

                      In the time I spent managing and working with Paul, I found him to be an excellent teacher with a genuine passion for helping people improve their language skills. Paul could be relied on to keep his students happy, but was always willing to learn and improve his teaching techniques and knowledge. Furthermore, he was a very friendly and supportive colleague, who contributed a lot to the pleasant atmosphere in our school. I would have no hesitation in recommending him as an EFL teacher to any organisation looking to recruit a reliable, skilful and committed individual.

                      Paul is a very personable colleague with a strong desire--and ability--to get the job done right in the workplace. While working at Windsor, he came to me several times with questions about how to teach a particular topic or about how to best organize a class, but his questions were never simple matters of basic information--they always demonstrated a thoughtfulness and complexity well beyond the level of most new teachers. 
                   
                        As I have already mentioned, Paul has a warm, communicative personality. This made him an immediate favourite among his colleagues and the office staff. I have no doubt that Paul will be able to take his talents and abilities and apply them successfully in any professional field.

                    I was taught individually by Paul for 7 months and my English improved from pre-intermediate to upper-intermediate despite only having 2 lessons a week. Paul was always well prepared. Also when he didn't know how to answer any of my question he told me that he didn't know and looked it up for the next lesson. Then prepared several very interesting and fun exercises and tasks for this theme. He was so enthusiastic that I had a feeling that he was involved in my education process, sometimes much more than me. I really enjoyed our lessons and he was the perfect English teacher, it's a pity that he left Russia.
